# ﻿Transfer Learning based Text summarization using CNN/Daily-Mail


**Abstract**
\
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text summarization. However, LLMs are typically trained on massive datasets of text and code, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect and curate. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning approach for adapting the Llama-2 LLM to the task of text summarization on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned Llama-2 model on a variety of summarization tasks, including email, letter, and news article summarization. The results show that the fine-tuned Llama-2 model is able to generate high-quality summaries for these tasks, comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art summarization models. This work has the potential to make LLM-based text summarization more accessible to a wider range of users, as it does not require the collection or curation of a large dataset. Additionally, the fine-tuned Llama-2 model can be used to generate summaries for a variety of different text genres, making it a versatile tool for a range of applications.

# **1. Introduction** 
Text summarization is a vital natural language processing task, with diverse applications spanning news articles, email management, and scientific literature. This task primarily falls into two categories: extractive summarization, where crucial sentences are selected from the source text, and abstractive summarization, where the system generates a summary that may not directly mirror the input.

One of the pivotal techniques for text summarization involves sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. These neural networks effectively map input sequences (source text) to output sequences (summaries). For the intricate task of text summarization, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, are particularly suitable. LSTMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies in input sequences, a critical requirement for summarization tasks.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for text summarization. These models, trained on extensive text and code datasets, exhibit impressive capabilities across various natural language processing domains, including summarization. Notable LLMs such as BERT, BART, and Pegasus have demonstrated their prowess in generating summaries.

A recent addition to this landscape is Llama-2, a substantial advancement over its predecessor. This dense decoder model boasts a substantial parameter size of 7 billion, an expanded context length, and enhanced performance across multiple benchmarks.

The pretrained models come with significant improvements over the Llama 1 models, including being trained on 40% more tokens, having a much longer context length (4k tokens), and using grouped-query attention for fast inference of the 70B model. For fine tuning the Llama-2 model we have used CNN/Dailymail dataset. The CNN/DailyMail is a non-anonymized summarization dataset with two features: - article: text of news article which is used as the document to be summarized and highlights which is the target summary.

The sharded llm model “NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-hf” was trained on CNN/Dailymail dataset using the SFT Trainer function from TRL module in python for 2 epochs with a batch size of 4 and learning rate of 1e-4 using the “PagedAdamW” optimizer with 32-bit floating point precision

**Dataset**- The CNN/Daily Mail dataset was a valuable resource for research in natural language processing and machine learning. It was collected in the past and consisted of news articles and their corresponding summaries. The dataset contained a substantial number of examples, comprising approximately 311,971 training instances, 11,469 validation instances, and 11,490 test instances. These articles covered a wide range of topics and were accompanied by human-generated abstractive summaries.

The primary application of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset was to facilitate research in text summarization, which is the task of generating concise and coherent summaries from longer documents. Researchers leveraged this dataset to develop and evaluate various abstractive summarization techniques. The dataset's large scale and diversity allowed for the training and testing of state-of-the-art models, leading to significant advancements in the field. Researchers aimed to improve the quality of automatically generated summaries, making them more informative and similar to human-written summaries. As a result, the dataset played a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of natural language processing models, ultimately benefiting applications such as news summarization, document summarization, and information retrieval.

**OCR Space-** Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that revolutionized the digitization of text by enabling machines to recognize and extract text content from printed or handwritten documents.

**4. RESULTS**

The primary objective was to create a user-friendly text summarization web application, and this was achieved through a seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies and APIs. The project successfully harnessed React JS and Tailwind for building a sophisticated and intuitive frontend, while the backend was powered by Python. The fine-tuning of the Llama-2 model played a pivotal role in enabling efficient and highly effective text summarization. Additionally, the integration of the OCR Space API provided an innovative solution for recognizing sentences within both documents and images, which could subsequently be employed in the summarization process. The project's repertoire was further enriched by the inclusion of a web parser that, upon receiving a URL, skillfully extracted textual content from websites.

This multi-faceted approach significantly enhanced the project's capabilities, making it a robust and versatile tool for text summarization. In order to assess the effectiveness of the text summarization performed by the system, several evaluation metrics were employed. These metrics play a crucial role in determining the quality and coherence of the generated summaries. Below are the primary evaluation metrics used in this project:

BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score): The BLEU score measures the quality of the generated summary by comparing it to reference text. It calculates the precision of overlapping n-grams (subsequences of n words) between the candidate summary and the reference text. 

Where, BP is the brevity penalty, N is the maximum n-gram order, Wn is the weight of the n-gram, Pn is the precision of n-grams.

ROUGE Scores (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): ROUGE includes a set of metrics that assess the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference documents. The primary ROUGE metrics used are ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, which focus on unigram, bigram, and longest common subsequence precision. 

Where, ROUGE-N refers to either ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2, Precision is the ratio of overlapping n-grams in the candidate summary and reference text.

BERT Score: BERT Score assesses the quality of summaries by leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings. It evaluates the similarity between the candidate summary and the reference text using BERT representations. The score is based on precision, recall, and F1 score. 

The evaluation metrics of the text summarization model, such as ROUGE score, BLEU score, and BERT score, are lower due to the computational restrictions that limited the training process to two epochs with a maximum sequence length of 1024, using QLoRA and the SFTTrainer. QLoRA, or Quantized Low-Rank Adapters, is a technique that allows LLMs to be trained on a single GPU by using a small number of quantized, updateable parameters.
