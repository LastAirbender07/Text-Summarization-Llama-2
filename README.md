1. # **Introduction** 
Text summarization is a vital natural language processing task, with diverse applications spanning news articles, email management, and scientific literature. This task primarily falls into two categories: extractive summarization, where crucial sentences are selected from the source text, and abstractive summarization, where the system generates a summary that may not directly mirror the input.

One of the pivotal techniques for text summarization involves sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. These neural networks effectively map input sequences (source text) to output sequences (summaries). For the intricate task of text summarization, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, are particularly suitable. LSTMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies in input sequences, a critical requirement for summarization tasks.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for text summarization. These models, trained on extensive text and code datasets, exhibit impressive capabilities across various natural language processing domains, including summarization. Notable LLMs such as BERT, BART, and Pegasus have demonstrated their prowess in generating summaries.

A recent addition to this landscape is Llama-2, a substantial advancement over its predecessor. This dense decoder model boasts a substantial parameter size of 7 billion, an expanded context length, and enhanced performance across multiple benchmarks. Llama-2 stands out due to several key advantages. Firstly, its size and power facilitate the comprehension of intricate relationships within input text. Secondly, its training on an extensive corpus of text and code equips it with a vast knowledge base. Lastly, its specialized design for text summarization enables the generation of informative, concise summaries.

The versatility of Llama-2 in text summarization is noteworthy. It can be applied to single or multiple text documents, covering various genres such as news articles, scientific papers, and emails. Some specific use cases include:

- News Summarization: Llama-2 offers efficient summaries of news articles, benefiting individuals seeking to stay informed amid busy schedules.

It was collected in the past and consisted of news articles and their corresponding summaries. The dataset contained a substantial number of examples, comprising approximately 311,971 training instances, 11,469 validation instances, and 11,490 test instances. These articles covered a wide range of topics and were accompanied by human-generated abstractive summaries.

The primary application of the CNN/Daily Mail dataset was to facilitate research in text summarization, which is the task of generating concise and coherent summaries from longer documents. Researchers leveraged this dataset to develop and evaluate various abstractive summarization techniques. The dataset's large scale and diversity allowed for the training and testing of state-of-the-art models, leading to significant advancements in the field. Researchers aimed to improve the quality of automatically generated summaries, making them more informative and similar to human-written summaries. As a result, the dataset played a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of natural language processing models, ultimately benefiting applications such as news summarization, document summarization, and information retrieval.

**OCR Space-** Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that revolutionized the digitization of text by enabling machines to recognize and extract text content from printed or handwritten documents. In the past, OCR solutions like OCR Space were instrumental in automating data entry, making it far more efficient than manual data transcription. The OCR Space API provided a seamless interface for developers to integrate OCR capabilities into their applications and services. This API allowed users to submit images or scanned documents, which were then processed by the OCR engine to extract text data.

**IV RESULTS**

The primary objective was to create a user-friendly text summarization web application, and this was achieved through a seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies and APIs. The project successfully harnessed React JS and Tailwind for building a sophisticated and intuitive frontend, while the backend was powered by Python. The fine-tuning of the Llama-2 model played a pivotal role in enabling efficient and highly effective text summarization. Additionally, the integration of the OCR Space API provided an innovative solution for recognizing sentences within both documents and images, which could subsequently be employed in the summarization process. The project's repertoire was further enriched by the inclusion of a web parser that, upon receiving a URL, skillfully extracted textual content from websites.

This multi-faceted approach significantly enhanced the project's capabilities, making it a robust and versatile tool for text summarization. In order to assess the effectiveness of the text summarization performed by the system, several evaluation metrics were employed. These metrics play a crucial role in determining the quality and coherence of the generated summaries. Below are the primary evaluation metrics used in this project:

BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score): The BLEU score measures the quality of the generated summary by comparing it to reference text. It calculates the precision of overlapping n-grams (subsequences of n words) between the candidate summary and the reference text. 

Where, BP is the brevity penalty, N is the maximum n-gram order, Wn is the weight of the n-gram, Pn is the precision of n-grams.

ROUGE Scores (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): ROUGE includes a set of metrics that assess the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference documents. The primary ROUGE metrics used are ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, which focus on unigram, bigram, and longest common subsequence precision. 

Where, ROUGE-N refers to either ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2, Precision is the ratio of overlapping n-grams in the candidate summary and reference text.

BERT Score: BERT Score assesses the quality of summaries by leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings. It evaluates the similarity between the candidate summary and the reference text using BERT representations. The score is based on precision, recall, and F1 score. 

The evaluation metrics of the text summarization model, such as ROUGE score, BLEU score, and BERT score, are lower due to the computational restrictions that limited the training process to two epochs with a maximum sequence length of 1024, using QLoRA and the SFTTrainer. QLoRA, or Quantized Low-Rank Adapters, is a technique that allows LLMs to be trained on a single GPU by using a small number of quantized, updateable parameters.

| NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) -- India has elected its first female president, official results show, in what supporters are calling a boost for the rights of millions of downtrodden women, despite a bitter campaign marked by scandal. Pratibha Patil, 72, is India's first elected female president. Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. "This a victory of the people," Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. "I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold." Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. "This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India," Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as "mud-slinging", said on Saturday her victory was "a vote against the politics of divisiveness". "All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered," Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a "divine premonition" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized. E-mail to a friend .

| (CNN) -- China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful "date rape" drug, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a "date rape" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic "date rape" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. "Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures," a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name "Aqua Dots," have also been distributed in Australia under the name "Bindeez Beads." The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. "I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it," Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old "swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time." The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since "fully recovered." The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as "out of stock online" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning.

| (Mental Floss) -- 1. The SPAM® Museum . SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site "wall of SPAM" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History . It's pretty hard to argue with the motto "Any Day Above Ground is a Good One." So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of "fantasy coffins" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum . If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the "hobo jungle," located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have "caught the westbound" are laid to rest. 4. The Mütter Museum . Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum . What better way to honor "Greatest Show on Earth" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean "enthusiasts") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum . There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring "mainstream" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices . Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum . What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum . So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum . Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T . our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

| PARIS, France -- France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. "In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone," said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. "They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50." Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. "We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked," director of rugby Rob Andrew said. "He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. "The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. "The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game."

| JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg. Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. "The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot," said coach John Bracewell.

##### **V Conclusion**
`	`Conclusively, this project marks a substantial advancement in the domain of text summarization, harnessing the capabilities of sophisticated language models, such as Llama-2, to facilitate a more streamlined and efficient summarization of textual documents. The deployment of a family of fine-tuned LLMs, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, allowed for substantial improvements over previous models in terms of token training, context length, and inference speed. The utilization of the CNN/DailyMail dataset for fine-tuning, which comprises articles and highlights, proved instrumental in enhancing the summarization capabilities of Llama-2, setting the stage for its successful application in this web-based text summarization tool.

This project has unlocked the potential for users to effortlessly generate concise and informative summaries from a variety of textual sources, including documents, images with OCR conversion, and website content. The fusion of OCR Space API integration with the powerful Llama-2 model provides a holistic

solution for summarization, where the model is capable of ingesting text content from diverse origins. This endeavor not only strengthens the accessibility of text summarization but also underscores the prospect of augmenting and diversifying this tool for a broader user base.

In terms of future prospects, there are several avenues for improvement. The Llama-2 model itself is a dynamic area of research with room for further fine-tuning, and the exploration of additional domains and training datasets could enhance its summarization performance. Additionally, extending the tool to support other languages and character sets, or even real-time web content summarization, would broaden its utility. Collaboration with the academic and research community for a more extensive evaluation and benchmarking of the tool's performance could provide valuable insights. Ultimately, this project represents a notable achievement in the realm of text summarization, opening doors for further advancements and contributions to this critical area of natural language processing.
